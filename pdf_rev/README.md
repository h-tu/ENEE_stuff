# pdf reverse tool

### Installation 

For linux:

```
sudo apt install python3 
sudo apt install pip3
```

Download the rev.py file and put it in the same directory as the file(s) that you want to reverse.

In that same directory before running: 

```
pip3 install subprocess
pip3 install PyPDF2
```

Run the script by typing: 

```
python3 rev.py 
```

### Latest feature

Now support multiple-file conversion at the same time. It only matches the pdf file in the same directory and leave other files untouched.
